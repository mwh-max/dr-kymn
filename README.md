Dr. KYMN

Dr. KYMN (Kentucky Medicaid Notebook) is a living resource built to help Kentuckians understand their Medicaid options in plain language.

The project fills a gap: while state and federal guidance exists, it is often fragmented, outdated or difficult to navigate. Dr. KYMN provides a clear, structured way to find answers.

Purpose

Make state-specific Medicaid information easier to access

Provide printable, pocket-sized references

Offer credible guidance without jargon

Build toward a community-updated notebook as Medicaid rules evolve

Features

Searchable, card-style interface for quick lookups

Accessible typography and layout, printable in black and white

Mobile-friendly design

Why It Matters

Medicaid rules can be confusing—federal guidance does not always match how Kentucky applies them. Families, providers and community advocates need clear, Kentucky-specific answers.

Dr. KYMN aims to provide timely, reliable and user-friendly information that cuts through the noise.
